# macOS provisioning

1. `git clone https://github.com/shields/dotfiles.git ~/src/github.com/shields/dotfiles`
   (macOS offers to install git with the command line tools the first time you
   run it)
1. `cd ~/src/github.com/shields/dotfiles`
1. `./provision.sh`
1. Reboot

Additional steps not yet automated:

- Open Karabiner-Elements and grant permissions
- Open Chrome and sign in
- Open System Preferences:
  - Users & Groups > Login Items: add Karabiner-Elements

Many preferences can be translated to `defaults write` settings using
`tools/diff_defaults.py`.

# Brewfile modules

What `provision.sh` installs with Homebrew is split into modules,
`brew/<module>.Brewfile`. The `Brewfile` in the root only loads `base`, the
operating system's own module (`macos` or `linux`) and the optional modules
that are selected.

| Module  | Contents                                                                                                       |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base`  | Always installed: git, gh, shell tools, Python, Node, Go, uv, the Claude Code and Codex casks, and lgtmcp.     |
| `dev`   | Linters, formatters, language servers, compilers and other development tools, and the cargo, go and npm tools. |
| `cloud` | Cloud and Kubernetes command-line tools, including the Google Cloud CLI.                                       |
| `data`  | Databases, notebooks, mail and sync tools.                                                                     |
| `media` | Image, audio and video tools.                                                                                  |
| `macos` | Always installed on macOS: casks, Mac App Store apps, GNU tools, Emacs Plus and other macOS-only packages.     |
| `linux` | Always installed on Linux: Emacs.                                                                              |

```
./provision.sh [--remove-modules] [MODULE... | none]
```

- The selection is saved in `~/.config/dotfiles/brew-modules`, as a
  space-separated list that may be empty. Without arguments, `./provision.sh`
  uses the saved selection. Where none is saved, macOS installs every optional
  module and Linux installs `dev`.
- Module names on the command line replace the saved selection. `none` selects
  no optional modules.
- Naming fewer modules than are installed would uninstall their packages, so
  `provision.sh` stops and prints what `brew bundle cleanup` would uninstall.
  Pass `--remove-modules` to go ahead.
- A module added to `brew/` is not installed on a machine that has a saved
  selection until you name it once, for example
  `./provision.sh dev cloud newmodule`.
- To change what a module installs, edit `brew/<module>.Brewfile`, or run
  `brew bundle add --file=brew/<module>.Brewfile ...` (or `remove`).
- To check a machine against its modules, run `brew bundle check --verbose` and
  `brew bundle cleanup` (without `--force`) in an interactive shell. The cargo
  entries are found only where rustup's `bin` is on the `PATH`, which `.zshrc`
  arranges.
- `brew bundle dump` no longer applies: it would replace the loader with a flat
  list.

# Persistent Linux box

A Linux machine that you reach over SSH gets the same shell, git, Emacs (in the
terminal) and agent setup as the Mac. It needs Debian 13 on x86_64 or arm64 and
a regular user with sudo; Homebrew refuses to run as root.

1. `sudo apt install git tmux`
1. `git clone https://github.com/shields/dotfiles.git ~/src/github.com/shields/dotfiles`
1. `cd ~/src/github.com/shields/dotfiles`
1. Run `tmux`, then `./provision.sh [MODULE...]` inside it, so that a dropped
   connection does not stop a run that takes tens of minutes. The default is the
   `dev` module; see Brewfile modules above.
1. If sudo asks for a password, expect two prompts: one at the start, for the
   packages that `provision/linux-system.sh` installs from apt, and a second one
   near the end, for the libraries that Playwright's browser needs.

`provision.sh` makes Debian's `/usr/bin/zsh` the login shell, generates the
`en_US.UTF-8` locale and installs Homebrew in `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`.
Running it again is safe, and takes a few minutes.

Nothing secret is in the repository, so log in once on each machine:

- GitHub: `gh auth login`, or a fine-grained token that is limited to the
  repositories you need: `gh auth login --with-token`. git uses `gh` as its
  credential helper.
- Claude Code: `claude login`, or run `claude setup-token` and put the token in
  `~/.config/secrets/CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (mode 0600). Interactive zsh
  shells export it from there.
- Codex: `codex login --device-auth`

Login shells set `LANG` to `en_US.UTF-8` when the SSH client did not send one,
but a non-interactive `ssh box command` runs without a `LANG` unless the client
sends it (`SendEnv LANG`, which the stock macOS `ssh_config` does).

# Testing on Linux

`make test-linux` needs Docker. It copies the checkout into a temporary
directory outside the repository with `tools/stage_tree.sh`, which includes
files that are not yet committed and scans them with gitleaks. It then builds
`cloudflare/Dockerfile` for the machine's own architecture with that directory
as the context, which runs `./provision.sh` just as on a Linux box, and finally
runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `make test lint` in the image as an
unprivileged user. It fails if any step fails.

`make test-linux MODULES="dev cloud"` provisions other modules (the default is
`dev`), and `LINUX_IMAGE` names the image (the default is
`dotfiles-linux-test`).
